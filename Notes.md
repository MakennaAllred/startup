I just completed the assignment to create my repository and push and pull from git and VS Code. 
I think it will take some getting used to, but it seems like a really useful tool. 

# Simon HTML
During this assignment I looked at what the HTML was doing. Because it is so new, it was nice to have Simon as an example. I think it will take som emore practice to understand how including lots of elements works, but overall I feel confident in attempting my own HTML pages.
