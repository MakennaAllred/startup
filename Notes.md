I just completed the assignment to create my repository and push and pull from git and VS Code. 
I think it will take some getting used to, but it seems like a really useful tool. 

# Simon HTML
During this assignment I looked at what the HTML was doing. Because it is so new, it was nice to have Simon as an example. I think it will take som emore practice to understand how including lots of elements works, but overall I feel confident in attempting my own HTML pages.


# Notes

Introduction
- The essential first step to enabling what we now call web programming was the formation of a global communications network that was reliable and publicly available. This was made possible when the United States Department of Defense created the ARPANET as a means of sharing information between universities doing defense related research.
- Tim Burners-Lee is responsible for HTML: One of the key innovations of HTML was the idea that documents could be interconnected with what he termed hyperlinks to allow immediate access to related documents. In 1990 he put all the pieces together and built the world's first web server on his desktop NeXT computer. You can visit a reproduction of the first web site at info.cern.ch.
-  Berners-Lee also made other significant contributions. This included the definition of the HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and the Uniform Resource Locator (URL). These two definitions specify how web documents are addressed and transmitted across the Internet. The following gives an example of a URL and HTTP request.

-  *JAVASCRIPT* :  JavaScript turned the previously static web into an interactive experience where a web page could dynamically change based upon a user's interaction. Brendan Eich

# The Internet 
Domain names are converted to IP address by doing a lookup in the Domain Name System (DNS). You can look up the IP address for any domain name using the dig console utility.
You can determine the hops in a connection using the traceroute console utility
- chmod: changes permissions to a file or directory
